  <center><h2>Department of Computer Science</h2></center>
  <p><b>Vision</b></p>

   <p>   To produce industry savvy dynamic professionals with ambitions towards innovations for global development</p>

<p><b>Mission</b></p>

   <p> To prepare students to function professionally as Computer Scientists and software engineers inculcate skills of programming develop critical thinking and problem – solving skills create aptitude to assume responsible positions in society Imbibe strong wills to lead the Nation in the progressive path in IT arena sow the seeds of entrepreneurial skills to add revenues to the treasury of the Nation.</p>

<p><b>Profile</b></p>

   <p> Computing came to ANJAC in 1986 when most of the parts of TamilNadu were not aware of the New IT revolution. The Course was started as Undergraduate Degree in Computer science having 24 students.</p>

    <p>The Department took various initiatives to spread computer literacy to all in the Campus. As a first step, we have conducted classes in BASIC, FORTRAN &COBOL to science &Arts faculty. The trained staff later taught these languages to the students of their disciplines. Postgraduate course viz. MCA, M.Sc. were started in 1992 & 1996 respectively. </p>

   <p> In 1996, the course was converted to vocational- Computer Maintenance by getting sponsorship from UGC. Ours is the First Arts & Science College in Tamilnadu to offer UGC Sponsored Computer Maintenance Course. The course was in practice for 5years. </p>

   <p> Later, it was again offered as Computer science & the Certificate & Advanced Diploma in Computer Maintenance were offered from 2002 onwards. The Certificate & Advanced Diploma programmes attracted the students very much. Department never fails to provide rich hands-on training to the students. </p>

    <p>Electronics, Hardware & Computer laboratories were setup with State-of the – art infrastructure.</p>

    <p>Laboratories faced many evolutions as per the changes in the IT sector. Right from very old MP/M, ARC net cards serial I/O card for QUAD core, GPUSYSTEM, Virtualization kits, IGBPS Ethernet BACKBONE adore the Computer laboratory. </p>

   <p> We equipped the Electronics and Hardware Laboratories using embedded kits, Micro controllers and various modules to motivate students in taking up projects in embedded systems. M.Phil. was started in 2004. A Separate section in Computer Science under self Finance category was stated in 2007.</p>

    <p>Instead of Certificate & Advanced Diploma in computer Maintenance, a Diploma in Computer Hardware & Servicing was offered which also attracted many students & they are very happy since they have started earning after taking up this programme. </p>

    <p>The Department renders its utmost services in providing Computer literacy to all students in the campus through Foundation in Information Technology for UG & Certificate Course in Information Technology for PG. Further, dept. designed Softwares to conduct Online Comprehension Examination for PG Courses & to set question papers. </p>

    <p>Students exhibit their programming skills in taking up projects extension activities every year for the needy govt. officials & other people. ICT enabled teaching & learning is part & parcel of our academic exercise.</p>

   <p> We use NPTEL Lectures by eminent experts in Abroad, webinars, VYAS Channel programmes. Availability of Multiple LCD projectors, Document Camera, Interactive board, Video Conferencing kits, smart room, E-learning softwares made ICT enabled teaching & learning a common thing. 6 Mbps Internet backbone & Campus Wide Wi-Fi spearhead the teaching & learning processes. </p>

  <p>  BYOD system is also being followed in classes & laboratories. Dept. conducted three funded programmes sponsored by  DST,CSIR & UGC. 2Minor Research & 1 Major research projects were approved by UGC. Staff member presented a paper in IEEE International Conference on Granular computing held at San jose, California, USA. Our students occupy top positions in all major concerns in India & Abroad.</p>
